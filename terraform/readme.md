# Production-grade EKS Platform for Enterprise AI Workloads (Reference)

This repository contains a reference implementation of a production-ready
Kubernetes platform on AWS, designed as an infrastructure foundation
for running enterprise AI workloads, including AI services and agent-based systems.

## Goals
- Reproducible and auditable infrastructure
- Clear separation of environments and trust boundaries
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- Production-oriented, enterprise-grade design decisions
- Platform readiness for AI workloads

## Scope (initial)
- AWS VPC and networking baseline
- Amazon EKS as a runtime for platform and AI workloads
- Terraform modules with clear boundaries
- CI/CD foundations for infrastructure changes
- Observability basics required for AI workloads in production
